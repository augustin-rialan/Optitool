DAGSolver v2:
This program computes the best allocation of the defender's bugdet on an ADDAG.
Its first parameter is a XML file generated by ADTool representing a ADDAG. The second argument is the overall budget of the defender.
The third one is the desired optimization goal. It can be either "Investment", or "Coverage".
Ex: "java -jar DAGSolver_v3.jar test_updated.xml 150 Investment"
The cost and impact of each basic action are parsed from ADTool's domains.

Note: Installing lpsolve 5.5.2.5 is needed to execute the program.

Installing lpsolve on a win64 computer:
You just need to copy the contents of the lib/win64 folder to your SYSTEM32 directory.
